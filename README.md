### General Practice
- Utilize a separate ***new*** branch for introducing/implementing any new/stable feature(s). Avoid a new branch for ✏ *typo-related* fixes & consider opening a PR instead.
- Adhere to the standard practice of utilizing the Conventional Commit extension when committing and pushing changes to your branch.
- Visit [twenty's](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty) repo for visualizing monorepo directory structure. (`packages/*`)
